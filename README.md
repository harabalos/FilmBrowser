Film Browser
Film Browser is a C++ application created by me for the 3rd semester project at Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB).

The application allows users to browse and search for films, view detailed information about them, and create a list of their favorite films. It uses the "sgg" library for its graphical user interface.

To use the application, clone the repository and compile the source code using a C++ compiler. Once compiled, run the executable file to launch the application.

Please note that the "sgg" library must be installed on your system for the application to run properly.

We hope you enjoy using Film Browser!

What We Gained
This project was a great opportunity for us to improve our skills in C++ programming. We gained experience in using a GUI library and implementing a functional application. Additionally, we improved our understanding of software development principles such as debugging and testing. Overall, this project was a great learning experience for both of us.
